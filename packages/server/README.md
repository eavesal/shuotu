## Get started

1. Install dependencies via `npm i`.
2. Run tests to make sure everything is fine, using `npm run test:all`.
3. Now, you can start the dev server, `npm run start`.
4. Check the output from step 3, if there are any red things, [contact me](mailto:lijingyu68@gmail.com).
5. Go to [GraphQL Playground](http://localhost:3000/graphql), to explore GraphQL server or start the client.
